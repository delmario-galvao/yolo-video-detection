# yolo-video-detection
This repository contains the Python scripts used for dataset filtering, annotation conversion, training, and video inference in a comparative study of YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n models applied to object detection in real-world urban scenarios.

The experiments are part of a research manuscript currently under review, titled "Object Detection in Urban Video Scenes Using Deep Learning Models Based on the YOLO Architecture".

The results can be seen in the following video:
